# Part 2 - Question 10: Linear Modeling
# Author: Jean Claude Jean ISHIMWE
# Description: Fits a linear regression model with CGPA as the response variable and selected predictors.
# =========================

# Fit the linear regression model
model <- lm(CGPA ~ Age + `Academic Pressure` + `Financial Stress`, data = data)

# Display the summary of the model
summary(model)

# Interpreting the Output:
# 1.Coefficients:
# Intercept: 7.670154 — This is the estimated average CGPA when all predictors (Age, Academic Pressure, and Financial Stress) are zero. In this context, it doesn’t have a practical meaning but serves as a baseline for the model.

# Age: 0.001264 — This means that for each additional year of age, the CGPA is expected to increase by 0.001264 points. However, the p-value (0.484056) is greater than 0.05, indicating that Age is not a statistically significant predictor of CGPA in this model.

# Academic Pressure: -0.024924 — This means that for each additional unit of Academic Pressure, CGPA is expected to decrease by 0.024924 points. The p-value (0.000114) is less than 0.05, indicating that Academic Pressure is a statistically significant predictor of CGPA.

# Financial Stress: 0.010066 — For each unit increase in Financial Stress, CGPA is expected to increase by 0.010066 points. However, the p-value (0.105541) is greater than 0.05, indicating that Financial Stress is not statistically significant in predicting CGPA at the 5% significance level.


# 2.Residuals:
# The residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted CGPA values) range from -7.7508 to 2.4052, with a median value close to zero (0.1167). This suggests that the model's predictions are fairly close to the actual data points, although there is some variability.


# 3.R-squared:
# Multiple R-squared: 0.0005998 — This means that only 0.06% of the variation in CGPA is explained by the predictors (Age, Academic Pressure, and Financial Stress). This is very low, indicating that these predictors don't explain much of the variability in CGPA.

# Adjusted R-squared: 0.0004924 — The adjusted R-squared accounts for the number of predictors in the model and is slightly lower than the R-squared, indicating that adding more variables doesn't significantly improve the model.



# 4.F-statistic:
# The F-statistic of 5.581 and its associated p-value (0.0007996) indicate that at least one of the predictors is statistically significant in explaining the variance in CGPA. This suggests that the model as a whole is useful, even though the individual predictors are not all significant.



# Summary:
# The significant predictors in the model are Academic Pressure, which negatively impacts CGPA, and the Intercept, which represents the baseline CGPA when the predictors are zero.
# Age and Financial Stress do not significantly contribute to explaining the variation in CGPA based on their high p-values.
# The model's R-squared value is very low, suggesting that the selected predictors do not explain much of the variance in CGPA. Consider adding more relevant predictors to improve the model's explanatory power.
